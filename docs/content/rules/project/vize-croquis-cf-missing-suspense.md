# `vize:croquis/cf/missing-suspense`

An async dependency is used outside a Suspense boundary.

Default severity: Not emitted  
Applies to: Analyzed component graph and the supported facts described below  
Automatic fix: None; review related files and apply the repair  
Options: No per-code options; supported CLI findings accept severity overrides

This is a published diagnostic contract without a current producer. The Bad/Good scenario below explains the risk and repair; no flag currently makes this code trigger.

## Shared project files

Use these unchanged files in both Bad and Good. Install the imported packages in the project: Vue, plus vue-router or Pinia where shown. Follow any version-specific support note. The entry root makes the component relationship explicit.

`main.ts`

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
createApp(App).mount('#app');

```

`index.html`

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Contract scenario</title></head>
<body><div id="app"></div><script type="module" src="/main.ts"></script></body></html>

```

`AsyncCard.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const message = await Promise.resolve('Ready');
</script>

<template>
<p>{{ message }}</p>
</template>

```

## Bad

`AsyncCard` has top-level await, making its setup asynchronous, but App renders it without a Suspense boundary to coordinate that dependency.

`App.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import AsyncCard from './AsyncCard.vue';
</script>

<template>
<AsyncCard />
</template>

```

## Good

App wraps the async child in `Suspense` and supplies a loading fallback until the child setup resolves.

`App.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Suspense } from 'vue';
import AsyncCard from './AsyncCard.vue';
</script>

<template>
<Suspense><AsyncCard /><template #fallback><p>Loading…</p></template></Suspense>
</template>

```

The Good files demonstrate the change described above; other diagnostics can still apply to the complete project.
