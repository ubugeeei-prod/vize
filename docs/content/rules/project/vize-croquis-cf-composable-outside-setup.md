# `vize:croquis/cf/composable-outside-setup`

A composable is called outside `setup`.

Default severity: Not emitted  
Applies to: Analyzed component graph and the supported facts described below  
Automatic fix: None; review related files and apply the repair  
Options: No per-code options; supported CLI findings accept severity overrides

This is a published diagnostic contract without a current producer. The Bad/Good scenario below explains the risk and repair; no flag currently makes this code trigger.

The concern is this lifecycle-dependent composable, not a blanket ban on ordinary utility functions or all Composition API calls outside setup. This contract has no current producer.

## Shared project files

Use these unchanged files in both Bad and Good. Install the imported packages in the project: Vue, plus vue-router or Pinia where shown. Follow any version-specific support note. The entry root makes the component relationship explicit.

`main.ts`

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
createApp(App).mount('#app');

```

`index.html`

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Contract scenario</title></head>
<body><div id="app"></div><script type="module" src="/main.ts"></script></body></html>

```

`App.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useTitle } from './use-title';
const title = useTitle();
</script>

<template>
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
</template>

```

## Bad

Importing `use-title.ts` registers `onMounted` before a component setup is active. Calling its exported function later only returns that module-level ref; it cannot repair the missed lifecycle ownership.

`use-title.ts`

```ts
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue';
const title = ref('Before mount');
onMounted(() => { title.value = 'Mounted'; });
export function useTitle() { return title; }

```

## Good

Both state creation and hook registration move into `useTitle`, which App calls synchronously inside setup. The mounted hook now belongs to that App instance.

`use-title.ts`

```ts
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue';
export function useTitle() {
  const title = ref('Before mount');
  onMounted(() => { title.value = 'Mounted'; });
  return title;
}

```

The Good files demonstrate the change described above; other diagnostics can still apply to the complete project.
