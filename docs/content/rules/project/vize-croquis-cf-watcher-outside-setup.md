# `vize:croquis/cf/watcher-outside-setup`

`watch` or `watchEffect` is called outside `setup`.

Default severity: Not emitted  
Applies to: Analyzed component graph and the supported facts described below  
Automatic fix: None; review related files and apply the repair  
Options: No per-code options; supported CLI findings accept severity overrides

This is a published diagnostic contract without a current producer. The Bad/Good scenario below explains the risk and repair; no flag currently makes this code trigger.

Module-scope watchers are valid when their owner keeps and calls a stop handle or intentionally gives them application lifetime. This example requires component-owned lifetimes; the contract has no current producer.

## Shared project files

Use these unchanged files in both Bad and Good. Install the imported packages in the project: Vue, plus vue-router or Pinia where shown. Follow any version-specific support note. The entry root makes the component relationship explicit.

`main.ts`

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
createApp(App).mount('#app');

```

`index.html`

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Contract scenario</title></head>
<body><div id="app"></div><script type="module" src="/main.ts"></script></body></html>

```

`App.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Observer from './Observer.vue';
</script>

<template>
<Observer /><Observer />
</template>

```

`Observer.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useObserver } from './use-observer';
const { count, observed } = useObserver();
</script>

<template>
<button @click="count++">{{ count }}</button><p>{{ observed }}</p>
</template>

```

## Bad

The watcher is created at module load, outside either Observer’s setup, and both instances share its refs. It is not automatically stopped when a particular Observer unmounts.

`use-observer.ts`

```ts
import { ref, watch } from 'vue';
const count = ref(0);
const observed = ref(0);
watch(count, next => { observed.value = next; });
export function useObserver() { return { count, observed }; }

```

## Good

Each synchronous setup call creates its own refs and watcher inside `useObserver`. Vue associates that watcher with the calling component’s lifetime.

`use-observer.ts`

```ts
import { ref, watch } from 'vue';
export function useObserver() {
  const count = ref(0);
  const observed = ref(0);
  watch(count, next => { observed.value = next; });
  return { count, observed };
}

```

The Good files demonstrate the change described above; other diagnostics can still apply to the complete project.
