# `vize:croquis/cf/async-no-suspense`

An async component is rendered without a Suspense boundary.

Default severity: warning  
Applies to: Analyzed component graph and the supported facts described below  
Automatic fix: None; review related files and apply the repair  
Options: No per-code options; supported CLI findings accept severity overrides

The experimental Rust CrossFileAnalyzer has a producer for this code. The CLI pass does not emit this individual code; configuring its ID does not enable that Rust pass. These scenarios describe the analyzer's supported graph/facts, not a Vite+ promise.

Current support: `no-source-async-fact`

The boundary producer reads macros.is_async(), but source parsing currently records top-level await on the script-setup scope instead. The complete Bad/Good source pair below therefore produces no async-no-suspense finding through the current CLI. It explains the Suspense convention; supplying the missing macro fact is implementation follow-up work.

## Shared project files

Use these unchanged files in both Bad and Good. Install the imported packages in the project: Vue, plus vue-router or Pinia where shown. Follow any version-specific support note. The entry root makes the component relationship explicit.

`main.ts`

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import Root from "./App.vue";
createApp(Root).mount("#app");
```

`index.html`

```html
<div id="app"></div>
<script type="module" src="/main.ts"></script>
```

## Bad

The child has top-level await but its parent supplies no `<Suspense>` boundary. Current source parsing does not supply the macro fact required to emit this code.

`App.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Child from "./Child.vue";
</script>
<template><Child /></template>
```

`Child.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const greeting = await Promise.resolve("Hello");
</script>
<template><p>{{ greeting }}</p></template>
```

## Good

The parent wraps the same async child in `<Suspense>` with a loading fallback. This demonstrates the convention; both source alternatives remain non-emitted by the current pass.

`App.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Child from "./Child.vue";
</script>
<template><Suspense><Child /><template #fallback><p>Loading</p></template></Suspense></template>
```

`Child.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const greeting = await Promise.resolve("Hello");
</script>
<template><p>{{ greeting }}</p></template>
```

The Good files demonstrate the change described above; other diagnostics can still apply to the complete project.
