# `script/no-reactive-destructure`

Disallow destructuring reactive objects which loses reactivity

[Bad](#bad) · [Good](#good)

Default severity: `warning`  
Presets: _none_  
Automatic fix: None; review the suggested change  
Applies to: JS/TS scripts in Vue SFCs; examples show the relevant Options API or script setup form  
Options: No rule-specific options. Severity and preset selection are configurable.

## Configuration (Vite+)

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@vizejs/vite-plugin/vite-plus";

export default defineConfig({
  lint: {
    vize: {
      "preset": "incremental",
      "rules": {
        "script/no-reactive-destructure": "warn"
      }
    },
  },
});
```

```sh
vp run lint
```

## Bad

`const { count, name } = state` copies primitive properties out of the `reactive` object, losing their connection to subsequent property changes.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { reactive } from "vue";
const state = reactive({ count: 0, name: "Ada" });
const { count, name } = state;
</script>
```

## Good

Destructuring `toRefs(state)` creates refs for `count` and `name`, keeping each binding linked to the original reactive property.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { reactive, toRefs } from "vue";
const state = reactive({ count: 0, name: "Ada" });
const { count, name } = toRefs(state);
</script>
```

Good avoids this rule's finding under the configuration above; other rules may still report diagnostics.
