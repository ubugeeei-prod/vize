# `vue/single-style-block`

Recommend having a single style block

[Bad](#bad) · [Good](#good)

Default severity: `warning`  
Presets: `happy-path`, `nuxt`, `ecosystem`, `opinionated`  
Automatic fix: None; review the suggested change  
Applies to: Vue SFC templates and blocks, with script context where the rule requires it  
Options: No rule-specific options. Severity and preset selection are configurable.

## Configuration (Vite+)

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@vizejs/vite-plugin/vite-plus";

export default defineConfig({
  lint: {
    vize: {
      "preset": "incremental",
      "rules": {
        "vue/single-style-block": "warn"
      }
    },
  },
});
```

```sh
vp run lint
```

## Bad

The component splits its scoped panel and title styles across two style blocks.

```vue
<style scoped>
.panel {
  color: red;
}
</style>

<style scoped>
.title {
  color: blue;
}
</style>
```

## Good

Both selectors stay scoped in one style block, satisfying the single-block convention without dropping either style.

```vue
<style scoped>
.panel {
  color: red;
}
.title {
  color: blue;
}
</style>
```

Good avoids this rule's finding under the configuration above; other rules may still report diagnostics.
