# `script/prefer-computed`

Prefer computed() for derived reactive state.

| Default severity | Presets | Automatic fix | Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `warning` | None | No | None |

Applies to: JS/TS scripts in Vue SFCs; examples show the relevant Options API or script setup form.

The watcher must only derive the destination. Editable copies and callbacks with other side effects are allowed.

## Bad

The watcher only copies a derivation of `count` into a second ref, `doubled`, so the derived state is maintained through manual synchronization.

```vue annotate="remove:2,4,5"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, watch } from "vue";
const count = ref(0);
const doubled = ref(0);
watch(count, (value) => { doubled.value = value * 2; });
</script>
```

## Good

`computed(() => count.value * 2)` expresses the derivation directly and removes both the extra writable ref and its synchronization watcher.

```vue annotate="add:2,4"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, computed } from "vue";
const count = ref(0);
const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2);
</script>
```

## Configuration (Vite+)

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@vizejs/vite-plugin/vite-plus";

export default defineConfig({
  vue: {
    linter: {
      "preset": "incremental",
      "rules": {
        "script/prefer-computed": "warn"
      }
    },
  },
});
```

Then run `vp run lint`.
